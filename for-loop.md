### For Loop

- For loop is the only loop in the go programming language
- it has multiple syntaxes
```go
for init ; condition; post {
    // zero or more statements
}
```

- above one is regular for loop.
- lets say you dont have init or post statements, then your for loop would be like this
```go
for condition {

}
```
- if you would like to do an infinite execution of for loop then you can do as below
```go
for {

}
```
- we have `break` and `return` to exit from for loop anytime.
